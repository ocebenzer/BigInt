# BigInt

BigInt is a library to do simple arithmetic operations for big numbers, possibly way higher than computers support normally.

## Documentation

### Features
- Integers between [-10^512, 10^512]
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div, mod) as you would expect from any integer value
- Logical operations (lt, leq, gt, geq, eq, neq)

## Usage
In order to use the project you need the following libraries:
- **gcc** (note that c++20 or higher is required)
- **cmake**
- [**doctest**](https://github.com/doctest/doctest)
